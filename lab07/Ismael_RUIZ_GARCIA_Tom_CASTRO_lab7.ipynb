    "2. Load the datasets. We should use this version of the copy_from command where we specify the name of the columns and the value for NULL in the file of origin. Notice how we are not specifying the id column, since that will be autogenerated by the DB. Caveat: once you have loaded the data, double check that the id/SERIAL column starts at 1. \n",

    "5. How many people with college education do manual labour?\n",
    "6. What is the minimum, mean and maximum capital gain and capital loss for every marital status?"
